# A python library for calculating/looking up various tissue properties for laser bioeffect calculations

To simulate the exposure of tissue (skin or retina) to laser radiation, several properties characterizing the thermo-optical response of the tissue are needed.
These include absorption coefficients, transmission coefficients, conductivity, density, specific heat, etc. This library is a collection of tissue property data
sets that have been reported in the literature.

# Installing

Install with pip (or your favorite virtual environment manager)

```bash
pip install tissue-properties
```

# Usage
